# Routomil Changelog

## 2026-02-16 - CLAUDE.md Rewrite

### Refactor: Condensed CLAUDE.md from 623 to 84 lines
- [x] Removed completed migration checklists (Phases 1-8) — historical context
- [x] Removed API payload examples — already in garmin-api.ts and messages.ts
- [x] Removed debugging guides and cookie instructions — task-specific
- [x] Removed duplicate file references and code snippets
- [x] Added architecture diagram, code organization table, release checklist
- [x] Files modified: CLAUDE.md

### Impact
- **Developer workflow:** CLAUDE.md is now a concise reference (~85 lines) with only universally applicable info
- No code changes

## 2026-02-16 - CI/CD Infrastructure

### Feature: GitHub Actions Workflows & Release Automation
- [x] Added version sync script to keep package.json and manifest.json in sync
- [x] Added extension packaging script to create distributable ZIP files
- [x] Created CI workflow for automated testing on push/PR
- [x] Created Release workflow for automated GitHub Releases on version tags
- [x] Files created:
  - scripts/sync-version.js
  - scripts/package-extension.js
  - .github/workflows/ci.yml
  - .github/workflows/release.yml
- [x] Files modified:
  - package.json (added `version` and `package` scripts)
  - .gitignore (excluded routomil-v*.zip)

### Impact
- **Developer workflow:** Simplified release process with `npm version patch/minor/major`
- **Automation:** CI runs on every push/PR (type check, tests, build, integration tests)
- **Distribution:** Automatic GitHub Releases with ZIP attachments on version tags
- **Quality:** No manual version syncing between package.json and manifest.json
- **Build artifacts:** ZIP files exclude source maps (19.41 KB vs 43.2 KB dist/)

### Technical Details
- CI workflow runs on ubuntu-latest with Node 18
- Uses npm ci --ignore-scripts (icons already committed)
- Release workflow supports pre-releases (tags with `-` like v1.1.0-beta.1)
- Uses softprops/action-gh-release@v2 with auto-generated release notes
- Coverage reports uploaded to codecov (optional, doesn't fail CI)

## 2026-02-16 - Course API Migration Complete

### Feature: Migrated from FIT File Upload to Garmin Course API
- [x] Implemented GPX to JSON conversion (src/lib/gpx-parser.ts)
- [x] Added CSRF token extraction (src/background/garmin-auth.ts)
- [x] Replaced upload logic with Course API (src/background/garmin-api.ts)
- [x] Updated service worker integration (src/background/service-worker.ts)
- [x] Added Garmin Course API types (src/shared/messages.ts)
- [x] Removed FIT dependencies (@garmin/fitsdk, fit-encoder.ts)
- [x] End-to-end testing verified and working

### Impact
- **Simpler:** JSON API instead of binary FIT encoding
- **Smaller:** Removed 370 KB @garmin/fitsdk dependency
- **Correct:** Creates courses (not activities) in Garmin Connect
- **Better:** Supports course names, descriptions, waypoints
- **Working:** Full sync flow tested with real Garmin account

### Breaking Changes
- None (transparent backend change, same user-facing features)

### Technical Details
- Course API endpoint: POST https://connect.garmin.com/gc-api/course-service/course
- Authentication: Session cookies + CSRF token from <meta> tag
- CSRF extraction: 6 regex patterns for robust token detection
- Activity types: 10=cycling, 17=hiking
- JSON payload includes: geoPoints, courseLines, boundingBox, elevation data
- Bundle size: 72.4 KB (down from previous FIT-based implementation)

### Files Modified
- src/lib/gpx-parser.ts - Added convertGpxToGarminCourse()
- src/background/garmin-auth.ts - Added getCsrfToken()
- src/background/garmin-api.ts - Replaced FIT upload with Course API
- src/background/service-worker.ts - Updated sync flow
- src/shared/messages.ts - Added Garmin Course types
